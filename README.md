# ELTE-FAIL
Demo

This is my sandbox project where I try out various things.

The Visual Studio project file is included.<br/>
However, if you want to **build**, you should have the Visual Studio solution file including other relevant projects as well in [PGE-misc](https://github.com/proof88/PGE-misc) repo.  
**Follow the build instructions** in [PGE-WoW.txt](https://github.com/proof88/PGE-misc/blob/master/src/PGE-WoW.txt).
